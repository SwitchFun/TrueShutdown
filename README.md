# TrueShutdown
What the community has been waiting for, a real shutdown homebrew application.
<br>
<br>
This application will initalize romfs, use Exosphere's Reboot-To-Payload feature to boot the payload "shutdown.bin" from romfs, shutdown.bin is a modified version of hekate with just the ipl_main calling power_off();
<br>
<br>
Note: <strong>After using this, to power on your console hold power for 30 seconds.</strong>
